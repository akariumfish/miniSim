Unperfect Simulation sandbox with visual scripting. To waste time making ephemeral worlds.

Using :
Java 1.8           -  https://www.java.com/en/ ; 
Processing 3.5.4   -  https://www.processing.org/ ;
Eclipse IDE        -  https://eclipseide.org/ ;
Launch4j           -  https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ ;

French Down   vvv  .

See previews for samples, more in the image folder.

Quick start :
Go to https://github.com/akariumfish/miniSim/blob/main/miniSim0.4.1.rar
 ; click on "view raw" to dowload 
 ; extract it somewhere then launch miniSim0.x.x.exe .

If nothing append or a windows flash brieffly, you probably dont have the correct version of java installed. See below.

Once the program is launched :
Click on the FS button then on the OP button on top right of the screen .
Click on any sdata file in the new windows - wait a little for loading - .

Java RE 8 is needed to launch the software. To get it go to : https://www.java.com/fr/download/manual.jsp then click Windows Online. After downloading, install this anywhere.

Please be aware that im not a pro, and its certainly not done correctly. This is not a serious projet !! Its a montain of unfinished idee, temporary setups on top of temporary fixs, quick and lazy solution driven by lack of sleep and depression, and be aware that it will surelly stay like that. I dont have the will and the means for fully fixing it. In fact Im surprised it got this far. So, for now, as long as i can keep making it more absurdly complex I will continue!

If you are here for the "art", thank you deeply! but please go see the galleries at https://grows.cloud, there is not much for you here. Otherwise, if you want to try making something, thank you dearly, and good luck. I made a series of vids showing the construction process of an exemple for the version 0.4.1 disponible on my site. On the next stable i changed the shape of certain blocks used inside the vids so its part obsolete already. And its full of bugs ... Im trying i swear but this damn project keep shapeshifting and thats the best part of it so its not going to change soon.

Q: Okay but roughly, what can i do whit it? 
A: there is three simulation systeme : growers makes vines and flowers, flocs are a shitty boids implementation, and solids do physics like friction, gravity, colision...
flocs and solid can interact with canvas and draw on it.
each of this system got a tons of param to finetune them.
secondly there is a set of block to access, display, modify or react to thoses params. by connecting blocks together you can automate things, build your creation environment the way you want, change param that should not be change and crash everything, or make a nice little video to show your friend. who know? just remember that probably half of it will be bugged beyond repair when the next stable version will come.

Learn to let go my friend. This. Is. Spaghetti.

---FRANCAIS---MINISIM---

Démarrage :
Ouvre https://github.com/akariumfish/miniSim/blob/main/miniSim0.4.1.rar
 ; clique sur "view raw" pour télécharger le fichier 
 ; décompresse le quelque-part et lance miniSim0.x.x.exe .

Si le programme ne se lance pas il faut probablement installer Java RE 8
https://www.java.com/fr/download/manual.jsp .

Sache que je ne suis pas un pro, et que ce programme n'est certainement pas construit comme il faudrait.

Merci de ton intérêt, il n'y as pas de doc, mais quelques exemples, bonne chance ...
